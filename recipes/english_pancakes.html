        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pancakes are flat, light, cakes that are cooked in a frying pan and typically made of eggs milk and flour. This recipe is based on the BBC's <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/easy-pancakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener nonreferrer">goodfood Easy pancakes recipe</a> but I have added my own tiny twists to it.
            Pancakes are made with simple ingredients and are a fun and easy treat to make for yourself.</p>

            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1tbsp sunflower of vegetable oil. plus a little extra for frying</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1tbsp brown sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put 100g plain flour, 2 large eggs, 300ml milk, 1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil and a pinch of salt into a bowl or large jug, then whisk to a smooth batter.</li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon of groud cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to the mix.</li>
            <li>set a frying pan on medium heat and put oil on it, just enough so the pancakes are lubricated. (not alot)</li>
            <li>When hot, cook your pancakes for roughly 1 min on each side, the goal is for them to be golden brown on each side but not black/burnt.</li>
            <li>Serve with a sweet or sour topping or on their own, the choice is yours.</li>
        </ol>
