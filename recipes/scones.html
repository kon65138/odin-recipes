        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500g plain flour (all-purpose flour)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>25 g (2 tablespoons) caster sugar </li>
            <li>2 heaped teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>50 g (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes</li>
            <li>25 g (1 1/2 tablespoons) lard or vegetable shortening (or simply use butter)</li>
            <li>250–300 ml full cream milk (whole milk)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to <strong>220°C (430°F)</strong> (without fan).</li>
            <li>Place a baking tray in the middle shelf of the oven to warm up while you are making the scones.</li>
            <li>Place the flour, salt, sugar and baking powder into the bowl of a KitchenAid or stand mixer.</li>
            <li>Add the butter and lard (or vegetable shortening), and briefly mix with the flat paddle attachment until the mixture resembles damp sand. Alternatively, you can do this by hand by simply rubbing the fats into the flour with your fingertips.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the milk and quickly mix everything together. You may not need all of the milk – just add enough milk until the mixture just comes together into a rough dough. Try not to overwork the dough as this may lead to tough scones later.</li>
            <li>Place the dough onto a floured work surface and pat it into a rectangle or circle shape about <strong>3 cm (1 inch) high</strong>.</li>
            <li>Cut your scones with a round cutter. You could also use a teacup or small glass to shape your scones. Dip the cutter into some flour to prevent the dough from sticking to it.</li>
            <li>You can make the scones as little or as big as you like, adjusting the baking time accordingly. I use a <strong>6 cm (2.5 inch)</strong> crinkle-edged cookie cutter to make fairly small scones.</li>
            <li>Lightly re-shape the dough as necessary, but try to handle the dough as little as possible.</li>
            <li>Arrange the scones closely together on a baking tray.</li>
            <li>Bake the scones in the oven for about 10-15 minutes (depending on size), or until they are lovely and golden.</li>
            <li>These scones are best served hot or warm, but they are also lovely served at room temperature.</li>
            <li>I recommend cutting in half and serving with Jam in the middle.</li>
        </ol>
